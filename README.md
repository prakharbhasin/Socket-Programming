## Description
The Program utilises to TCP Sockets to communicate between a Client, and a Server. 

## Working
The client sends the server 4 values - 
- X, which is the adjacency matrix of a directed graph.
- n which is the length of the path
- Starting vertex of the path, say B.
- Ending vertex of the path, say C.

The server sends back 2 responses - 
- A response Y or N, depending on the existence of a path of length n between B and C in graph X.
- The Image of the directed graph X.

The image of the graph is generated using Java Swing, and an image file of the graph is saved as "graph.png" in the same folder as the client and server. 

## Example
### Input (Server)
>  X:
> |   |   |   |   |   |  
> ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
> | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
> | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
> | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
> | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
> | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

> n: 2

> Source: A

> Destination: E

### Output (Client)

```bash
  Path of length 2 exists from A to E!
